# node.js-PA7
an assignment from 3D-CGA class

an application that allows the user to create a polygon mesh. The application must allow the user to:
*	Add/delete a polygon (triangle) surface.
* Edit a polygon.
*	Display the normal of a surface.
*	Save a mesh to a file.
*	Load a mesh from a file.
*	Display a mesh.
*	Rotate the mesh on the main axes.
*	Zoom the mesh in/out. 
*	Perform back face culling on the mesh. The user may toggle the back face culling on and off.
*	Bonus points for user friendliness. Negatives points for extreme user unfriendliness.

The polygons in this application are represented using a list of vertex coordinates.

You may use the built-in procedure for drawing a line.
